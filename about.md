My name is Javier, although all my friends call me Javi (it is more or less pronounced 'Khabi'). I am Spanish, but I moved to Austria a few years ago because I wanted to live in the Alps. I also lived in England (in Portsmouth) for a year, so feel free to choose your favourite language to speak to me among Spanish, English and German.

Almost all my hobbies that have nothing to do with embedded systems consist of activities in the mountains: climbing, trail running, backcountry skiing, hiking, biking... just anything that gives me a feel of freedom and a connection to nature. In my opinion keeping a good physical and mental balance is key to success.

But I guess you could not care less about my hobbies, so I will tell you what this blog and I have to offer. I have been working with embedded systems for more than a decade, covering from the first steps of hardware design up to userspace application programming. But my main field of interest has always been the middle layers: FPGAs, microcontrollers and most recently the Linux kernel, where I contribute both professionally and as a hobbyist.

Over the years I have come up with some good practices as well as nasty hacks to improve the quality of my work in those areas, and that is what I would like to share with everyone who is interested. I will also talk about projects I am working on and from time to time I would like to wander a bit and write about stuff that has nothing to do with technology. Sorry about that, but in the end that is my personal blog, isn't it? :wink:
